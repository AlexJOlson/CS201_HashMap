# CS201_TreeMapForStrings

The goal of this assignment was to create a map implemented as a Binary Search Tree that could be used to construct a rudimentary search engine. Specifically, we could load up all of the titles and plots from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) into the map, and then allow the user to request titles and plots for all movies that start with a particular prefix.
